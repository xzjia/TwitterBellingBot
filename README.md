Twitter Belling Bot
=================

* Dumb Twitter bot belling now and then. Find it at [@BellingBot](https://twitter.com/BellingBot). 

* The most important part is done by [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/). 

* The application is hoted on Google App Engine. The homepage doesn't contain too much information, thus it's not included here.

* For obvious reason, the `keys.py` used to access the Twitter API is not included neither. An example of `keys.py`  could be 

    ```python
    keys = dict(
        consumer_key =          'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA',
        consumer_secret =       'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
        access_token =          'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC',
        access_token_secret =   'DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD',
    )
    ```

* Improvements could be made in a lot of ways (URL protection, make good use of 140 character and etc.). I'll try to refine it if some good ideas come to me in the future.
